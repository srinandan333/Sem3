                        Believe it or not, this is the most asked question that astronomers encounter.
                        Many people do not understand the difference. In ancient times, they were 
                        considered one and the same. But the two disciplines were separated during the 
                        Age of Reason in the 17th century. Astrology is a practice of using the locations 
                        of the planets to look into a person's personality or predict the future. 
                        It is not a science and is considered a form of divination. By contrast, 
                        astronomy is the scientific study of the universe. Astronomers observe the 
                        objects in the night sky to try to determine their composition and 
                        learn more about the origin and structure of the universe.

                        Many people hesitate to get involved with astronomy because they believe 
                        it requires expensive equipment. The only thing you really need to enjoy 
                        the night sky is your eyes, a dark viewing location, and some patience. 
                        To get a better look at things, a pair of binoculars can provide a really 
                        good view. Many people will be surprised how many more stars and objects 
                        they can see with a decent pair of 10X binoculars. 
                        They collect much more light than the human eye and will bring much 
                        dimmer objects into view. You can even see Jupiter’s moons with binoculars. 
                        A simple camera tripod to steady the binoculars is also a good idea, 
                        since your arms can get tired very quickly.

                        The distance between the Moon and the Earth averages 238,857 miles (384,403 kilometers). 
                        Since the Moon’s orbit is not a perfect circle, its distance varies. </p>

                        Comets are relatively small Solar System bodies composed of ice and dust. 
                        Due to this unusual composition, many astronomers refer to them as “dirty snowballs”. 
                        It is believed that most comets originate in an area at the outer edge of the Solar System 
                        known as the Oort cloud </p>

                        A star is a gigantic, luminous ball of heated gas, or plasma, held together by gravity. 
                        They are formed mainly of hydrogen and helium </p>
